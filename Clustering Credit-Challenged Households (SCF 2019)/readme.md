Clustering Credit-Challenged Households (SCF 2019)

This project explores financial data from the 2019 Survey of Consumer Finances (SCF) to identify and segment credit-challenged households in the United States.

Using clustering and dimensionality reduction techniques, the analysis uncovers patterns in household debt, income, and assets. The project also includes an interactive dashboard for visual exploration.

Applied KMeans clustering to group households

Used PCA for 2D visualization of clusters

Built an interactive Dash app to explore results by cluster count and feature selection

Libraries Used

Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly Express, Dash, Scikit-learn, SciPy
