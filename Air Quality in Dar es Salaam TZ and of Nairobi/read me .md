In this project, I worked on air quality data from two cities: Nairobi and Dar es Salaam. The work involved data wrangling, storage, and retrieval using MongoDB, followed by exploratory data analysis and visualization.

For Nairobi, I applied several time series forecasting techniques including Linear Regression, Autoregressive (AR), and ARMA models, tuning parameters to improve predictions. For Dar es Salaam, I focused on analyzing and visualizing air quality trends and also developed a predictive model based on the available data.

Overall, the project combines database management, statistical modeling, and data visualization to better understand and forecast air quality patterns in both cities.
