Brazil Real Estate Analysis
This project explores housing prices across Brazil using two real estate datasets. The goal was to clean, combine, and analyze the data to uncover regional trends in price and property size.

Tools Used
pandas for data wrangling

matplotlib & plotly.express for visualization

What I Did
Cleaned and merged two datasets

Converted BRL to USD prices

Removed missing values and outliers

Visualized home prices using maps, histograms, box plots, and bar charts

Focused on the South region to analyze how price relates to area across states

Key Insights
Prices are skewed, with a few high-end outliers

Property size doesn’t always strongly predict price

Some states show stronger size–price correlations than other
